- Python 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5
- NumPy 1.8 (or greater)
- SciPy 0.13 (or greater)
- matplotlib 1.3 (or greater)
- Cython 0.20 (or greater)
- properties[math]

Development Dependencies
------------------------
- sphinx
- sphinx_rtd_theme

- pylint

Installing Python
=================

Python is available on all major operating systems, but if you are getting started with python
it is best to use a package manager such as
`Continuum Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ or
`Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_.
You can download the package manager and use it to install the dependencies above.

.. note::
    When using Continuum Anaconda, make sure to run::

        conda update conda
        conda update anaconda


Installing discretize
=====================

discretize is on pip::

    pip install discretize


Installing from Source
----------------------

First (you need git)::

    git clone https://github.com/simpeg/discretize

Second (from the root of the discretize repository)::

    python setup.py build_ext --inline

This builds the cython extensions. You will also need to add
the discretize directory to your PYTHON_PATH.

.. attention:: Windows users

	A common error when installing the setup.py is:
	``Missing linker, needs MSC v.1500 (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008) Runtime Library``

	The missing library can be found `here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=29>`
